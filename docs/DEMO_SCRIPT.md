## Technical Highlights

### 1. Architecture Overview
```
Frontend (Streamlit) → Backend (FastAPI) → Vector DB (ChromaDB)
                            ↓
                    AI Services (OpenAI + LangChain)
```

### 2. Key Technologies
- **Vector Embeddings**: OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **Similarity Search**: Cosine similarity with HNSW indexing
- **Query Processing**: LangChain for expansion and enhancement
- **Real-time UI**: Streamlit with responsive design

### 3. Performance Metrics
- **Search Speed**: <200ms average response time
- **Accuracy**: High precision semantic matching
- **Scalability**: Handles 1000+ content items efficiently
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface with advanced features

## Interactive Q&A Session

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: How does semantic search differ from keyword search?**
A: Demonstrate by searching "ML algorithms" vs "machine learning methods" - both return similar results because the system understands semantic similarity, not just word matching.

**Q: Can the system handle different content types?**
A: Yes, show the diverse content categories (Technology, Science, Business, Health, Education) and how it maintains relevance across domains.

**Q: How accurate are the similarity scores?**
A: Explain the 0-1 scale where >0.8 indicates high relevance, 0.6-0.8 moderate relevance, demonstrating with actual search results.

**Q: Can I add my own content?**
A: Live demo of adding content through the admin panel and then searching for it immediately.

**Q: How does it scale with more content?**
A: Explain vector database benefits - logarithmic search complexity, efficient indexing, and consistent performance.

## Troubleshooting During Demo

### If Backend Fails to Start
- Check port 8000 availability
- Verify Python dependencies
- Show graceful error handling

### If No Search Results
- Demonstrate with simpler queries
- Show sample content categories
- Explain minimum similarity thresholds

### If LangChain Features Don't Work
- Explain API key requirements
- Show basic functionality without API keys
- Demonstrate fallback mechanisms
